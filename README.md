# Jacqueline-Hammer-Portfolio

## Description

This project contains a webpage showing my coding bootcamp portfolio. Its purpose is to show potential employers my skillset and give examples of work I have done. It includes my name, a picture of me, links to my resume and social media pages (right now these links are connected to generic webpages to protect privacy), an about me, and links to the deployed applications I have completed (I only have one so far). The page is designed to adjust to different window sizes in order to be compatible with various devices.
